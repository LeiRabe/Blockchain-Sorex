# Blockchain
## Projet Java
This project was set up as a part of the advanced object-oriented programming course [3I102 - LU3IN102] during the first semester (2019-2020).
The first aim of this project is to allow students to make safe file exchange and trasaction.
It's based on the server/client model, it is not distributed yet.
This is the first prototype of the prject, for now we have the client/server architecture, the clients can make transactions to each other through the server so each transactions are encapsulate in a new bloc and is shared for every connected client so it can be added to the blockchain after its minning.
